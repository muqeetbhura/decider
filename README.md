Can't make up your mind? Well you're not the only one. After struggling to pick places to eat with my friends, I decided to create a simple web app for us to use to come to a conclusion.

In order to create this web app, I utilized NextJS, React, and TypeScript. In order to design this project, I used MaterialUI.
